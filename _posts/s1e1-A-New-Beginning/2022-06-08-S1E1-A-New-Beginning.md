According to the Wayback Machine, the earliest snapshot of this site was from almost exactly 18 years ago. I'm fairly certain it predates this, by at least a year or so, but at the time of the snapshot, I was preparing to leave my small little world for "The Big City" in hopes that I'd be following my dreams and becoming a prolific programmer. After college, I wanted to work for Blizzard and make video games.

Of course, life is generally much more mundane, and instead I find myself in a different mold of success: I am happily employed, married, and a father. My job may not be exciting, but it pays the bills.

Over the years, I stopped updating the website as I pursued other interests and several attempts at creating a community forum ended up failing. For a time, the site housed my WoW guild, and after that was shut down, I ended up putting the 5th or 6th iteration of my forum up again, and that became the focal point of the site.

It was [this post](https://www.jennymikac.com/making-a-home/) from one of my longest friends that opines on how impersonal the digital world has become and Millenials seem to understand this quite well. After all, we grew up cultivating sites like Myspace, Xanga, LiveJournal, and MANY of us had our own websites to showcase our own personal interests. I've felt for a long time that I am severely underutilizing this website, but revisiting web design was just something I didn't have the motivation for, especially now that I had adult responsibilities. 

Jenny, who has altered the trajectory of her life multiple times for various reasons, has recently (over the past few years) been getting into coding, and her GitHub shows that she has way more activity than I do. After high school, most of my coding was centered around college projects and then work, where the respositories were private. 

Right before Covid hit, I was feeling stuck in a frustrating job (I was 10+ years into a career where I had only really used VB.net and SQL) and I wasn't sure how to break out. I had started doing the curriculum at [FreeCodeCamp.org](www.freecodecamp.org) and [theodinproject.com](www.theodinproject.com) in order to enhance my skillset and start creating a body of work in my GitHub, but pushed that aside to focus on a side project with a friend where we would be designing a web application using C# and newer web technologies. Back to code repositories I cannot show off.

This endevour didn't pan out, though I did manage to get myself out of the dire working situation I was in, and finding something that feels a lot more stable, and now I'm working with SQL and Azure Data Factory. Luckily, I'm still working from home, and I've been feeling the itch to do MORE, though I'm so lost on what exactly to do. 

Summer break just started for my kids and I suggested that they start doing the curriculum on FreeCodeCamp. I'm looking through Jenny's GitHub and I notice that she's using this Ruby Gem called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It sounded like a fun way to learn some new stuff, get my website back on track, and also submit everything to GitHub to start building up a body of work that doesn't rely on recalling the Al Bundy touchdowns of my highschool career.

Jenny refers to her online space as a digital garden, and I like the thought behind it. It can be as structured or unstructured as I like. Its mine. Parts of it can be methodically laid out, while others can be a bit more meandering and exploratory. Hopefully the blog posts wont be as rambling and boring as this post probably is. I never claimed to be an eloquent writer. But I want a place to call my own, somewhere I can express my views that doesn't get lost in the digital ether as easily as it does on Twitter and Facebook. Even if I don't get visitors here, I can still enjoy the fruits of my labor; just being a person who has thoughts and feelings and dreams.
